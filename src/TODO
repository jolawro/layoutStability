intersection observer vs implement resize, scroll & orientationchange
show how its done, not only talk how you should do it

If you want to get fancy, you can load the high quality 
image in a hidden IMG tag, and then swap the low quality 
image with it at the onload event. This will prevent the 
low quality image from disappearing before the full quality
image is fully downloaded, which can hinder the user 
experience.
